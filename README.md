# Python Data Analysis Project

This repository will contain an end-to-end data analysis project in Python.

📌 Problem Statement
This project aims to analyze loan data to uncover patterns in funding, repayments, and borrower financial health.
We will calculate several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to assist in strategic decision-making.

KPIs to be Analyzed:
Loan Application Volume – Count of all loan applications in a given period.

Disbursed Loan Amount – Total amount released to borrowers.

Repayments Collected – Total amount recovered from borrowers.

Portfolio Interest Rate – Average interest rate across active loans.

Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) – Average DTI to assess borrower repayment capacity.
